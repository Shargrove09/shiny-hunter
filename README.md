<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project
A Python-based project utilizing tools such as Tkinter and PyAutoGUI that allows the user to embed a running Pokemon game window into the application that then inputs a series of keystroke combinations to automatically encounter desired Pokemon and reset via until it runs into a shiny version of said Pokemon. (See: Shiny Hunting to learn more about shiny hunting) The keystrokes are directly input into the window so the application is able to run minimized and/or in the background to allow use of the computer while the task is completed.
Currently, as a proof of concept, the application is built only to look for shiny mewtwo colors.
